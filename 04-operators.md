# Operators and conditional code
## TL;DR

- Arithmetics: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`(Modulo), `^` (x to the power of y), 
- `>` (greater) and `<` (less), `>=` (greater or equal to), `<=` (less or equal to), `==` equals, `~=` does NOT equal
- `and`, `or`, `not` represent the concept of their same name
- If/elseif/else: `if x then y elseif y then z else aaa end`

Sometimes, you want code to only run under certain circumstances. We use Operators and conditional structure for these.

Operators are anything comparing two values, whilst conditional code only runs if it's condition is fulfilled - usually checked with those operators.

### Operators
Every operator will compare the value to it's left to the value on it's right.

We already know about comparing two values exactly to each other from earlier: `==` and `~=`.

The first operator `==` returns `true` if both values are exactly the same. This also means that if the datatype does not match, the comparison will return false!

The second operator with the squiggly line, `~=` does the exact opposite. If the values DON'T match, it returns true.

```lua
print("hello" == "hello") --returns true
print(42 == "42") --returns false - datatypes don't match! No coercion here.

print(69 ~= 420) --returns true - because the values don't match.
let ayylmao = "ayylmao"
print(ayylmao ~= "ayylmao") --returns false - the variable content is identical to the compared value!
```

Time for some MATH. You love that, don't you?

There are four operators that let you compare your variables in size: `<`, `>`, `<=` and `>=`. All of them should be really self explanatory:

`<` will return `true` if the left value is smaller than the right value. Adding the equals sign (`<=`) will return `true` if the left value is smaller *or equal to* the right value.

On the contrary, `>` will return `true` if the left value is greater than the right value, and the added equals sign (`>=`) will also return `true` if the left value is greater or equal to the right value.

Confused? In school, I was always taught it like this: Think of the comparison signs as a crocodiles (or an alligators) snout. The crocodile wants to eat stuff, but it will only eat stuff it can actually swallow - stuff smaller than itself.  You won't see a crocodile eating an elephant... right?

Now here's something interesting - this also works on alphabetical sorting. A is the "smallest" and Z is the "biggest"!

```lua
small = 69
big = 420
print(small < big) --true
print(small > big) --false
print("aaa" < "abc") --true
print("remove kebab") --remove kebab   Just remove it from the premises already 
```

Now for the logical operators. There are three flavours of these: `and`, `or`, and `not`.

`not` will invert the result you get, turning a true into a false and vice versa.

`and` requires both the first statement and the following statement to be true so that itself can output true.

`or` only requires one of the statements to be true, but doesn't mind if both were, either.

```lua
print(not true) --false, duh.

print(true and true) --true
print(true and false) --false

print(false or false) --false
print(false or true) --true
print(not true or true) --you can mix and match this stuff, try not to confuse yourself with not though.
``` 

### Conditional code
Here comes the juicy part. Suppose you only want to run a bit of code if some value is smaller or greater than some other value, and some other code should run if blah is blah blah blah blah. You get the idea.

The most commonly known one is the **if/elseif/else** statement.

*An if/elseif/else ternary always needs an if statement, but elseif and else are completely optional.*

Have a look at the example below:

```lua
fn_remove = function(input)
    if input == "kebab" then
        print("remove kebab from premises")
    elseif input == "awp" then
        print("drop awp pls")
    else
        print("ayylmao")
    end
end

fn_remove("kebab") --remove kebab from premises
fn_remove("awp") --drop awp pls
fn_remove("something else") --ayylmao
```

Now, first of all, you don't have to indent the code like this. It just makes it considerably more readable, so I highly suggest you do this.

Let's break this down:
At the very top, we create a variable called fn_remove, and we make it a function that can handle one input we will refer to as `input` in the function.

Inside the function, we create an `if` statement with it's keyword. The following bit `input == "kebab"` checks if the input is indeed "kebab".  The check stops with the keyword then. Should this check succeed, then "remove kebab from premises" will be printed out. If it doesn't, this bit of code is skipped.

The `elseif` statement then checks if the input is "awp". I think you get the idea. You can have as many elseif cases as you desire. However - these will only run if no previous check in the if statement has succeded. If Input was kebab, then the awp check will never occur.

Now the `else`. If none of the previous checks have succeded, you can make your code use this statement.

The keyword `end` closes the if statement, and the second `end` closes the function.

Something you should know: Other languages have something reffered to as **Ternaries.** This is basically a shorthand version of an if-else statement that you want to keep compact. **Lua does not have this.** Yes, you can bodge your own one, but just... don't. It's confusing as hell.

An example Ternary in **JavaScript, NOT Lua**:
```js
    return(condition ? true : false);
```
