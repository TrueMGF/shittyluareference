# Operators and Ternarys

## TL;DR

- Arithmetics: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`(Modulo), `^` (x to the power of y), 
- `>` (greater) and `<` (less), `>=` (greater or equal to), `<=` (less or equal to), `==` equals, `=~` does NOT equal
- `and`, `or`, `not` represent the concept of their same name
- `if something then x else y end`

Sometimes, you want code to only run under certain circumstances. We use Operators and Ternaries for these.
